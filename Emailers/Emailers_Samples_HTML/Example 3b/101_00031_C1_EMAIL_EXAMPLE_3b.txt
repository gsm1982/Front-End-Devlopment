GET A HEALTHIER BALANCE BY PAYING MORE

Hi <Forename>,

Did you know you can increase your minimum payment? This can help you 
get your finances in better shape and also save you on interest payments.

We’ll make the change to your Direct Debit from your payment due around 
<char_12>. If it isn’t enough to cover your minimum payment, we’ll take 
the minimum so you always pay enough.

RESHAPE YOUR BALANCE

-  7 out of 10 customers pay more than their minimum
-  Sign in to increase your Direct Debit
-  Simply choose an amount you can afford

Watch the video to see how it pays off in the long run


You can always change back to make minimum payments so why not try a 
new payment straight away?
